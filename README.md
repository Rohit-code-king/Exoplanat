# Exoplanat
Exoplanet Detection &amp; Analysis Using Space Telescope Data Developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze astronomical data from space telescopes (e.g., Kepler, TESS) for identifying potential exoplanets. The system processes time-series photometric data to detect transit signals and predict key orbital parameters.
